The project is aimed at developing an online platform for predicting and Identifying Rotten Fruits through
a Convolutional Neural Network. Recognizing rotten fruits has been crucial, especially in the agricultural
industry.
Humans are often used to classify fresh and rotten fruits, which is useless for fruit. Growers. People get
tired after performing the same task repeatedly, yet but robots don’t. The study thus suggested a
procedure for minimising labour requirements, manufacturing costs, and duration reducing manufacturing
time by spotting flaws in farm produce.

If flaws go undetected, infected fruits might spread disease. The fruitful ones. Consequently, we
suggested a model to stop the proliferation of evil. The output fruit photos from the suggested paradigm
divide the fruit into fresh and rotten categories. When used in this experiment, three different fruit
varieties—apples, bananas, and oranges.

Using a convolutional neural network, the features from the input fruit photographs are gathered, and the
images are then classified using the Max pooling, Average pooling, and MobileNetV2 architecture.
On a Kaggle dataset, the suggested model’s performance is evaluated, and by using MobileNetV2, it gets
the greatest accuracy in training data (99.46%) and validation set (99.61%). The Max pooling has a
validation accuracy of 94.97% and a training accuracy of 94.49%.

Additionally, the Average Pooling obtained 93.72% Validation Accuracy and 93.06% Training Accuracy.
According to the results, the suggested CNN model can tell the difference between fresh and rotten
apples.
